===== Hand Gestures ======
This is a course project for Prof. Manduchi's CMPE264 Computer Vision class.

Team members:
Fan Bai (fbai@ucsc.edu)
Ji Li (jli241@ucsc.edu)

Accomplishments:
Accurately recognize number of fingertips of a hand by number of vertices on
convex hull and furthest convexity defects.

Implementation of multipoint sampling is referred to Yalun Qin's app. (https://github.com/eaglesky/HandGestureApp)

Implementation of contour, convex hull and convexity defect extraction is original.
Contour and convex hull point filtering is original.
Ideas of convexity defect point filtering is from Simen Andresen's blog.
